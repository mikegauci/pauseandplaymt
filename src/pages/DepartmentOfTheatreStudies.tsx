                The Department of Theatre Studies
              </a>{" "}
              at the University of Malta has been a central hub for theatre
              education since welcoming its first students in 1988. It remains
              until today the leading institution for tertiary-level theatre
              education in Malta, offering a dynamic space where theatre,
              performance, and critical thinking come together.

              Educational Approach
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6">
              Programmes offered by the department explore theatre as a living
              and evolving practice deeply connected to the world around it.
              Courses examine how performance responds to social and political
              change, how spaces shape experiences, and how the role of the
              performer continues to develop.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-8">
              Inspired by current trends in Performance Studies, the Department
              looks at the roots of theatre practice in religious, political,
              and cultural traditions, while also embracing the future through
              contemporary theory and digital media.

              Interdisciplinary Focus
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-8">
              Added to this is the approach adopted by the academic staff
              whereby theatre is never considered in isolation but always in
              dialogue with music, dance, philosophy, and other theoretical and
              practical contexts. This makes the Department's approach strongly
              interdisciplinary, encouraging openness to a wide range of
              influences and practices.

              Career Development
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-300 mb-8">
              With a balance of critical inquiry and hands-on experience,
              students are also equipped with the necessary tools to be
              employable and work confidently within the broader cultural and
              creative sectors.
